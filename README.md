## Tools

### MÃ­m

[MÃ­m](https://github.com/lucianHymer/mim) is an automated persistent learning
system for Claude Code.

### Lebowskis aka l8s

[l8s](https://github.com/lucianHymer/l8s) is a dev container management system,
primarily to allow an agentic LLM to run in an isolated, repeatable, detachable
environment. Security is based on my weird setup where I have an unprivileged
LXC container whose only job is to be a podman host. Don't run locally, let me
know if you have interest in me making a version that runs locally on docker or podman.
