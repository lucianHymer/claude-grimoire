### [15:19] [architecture] CLAUDE.md file linking depth
**Details**: Claude Code supports recursive file imports up to 5 hops deep. This means CLAUDE.md can link to files, which can link to other files, up to 5 levels total. This allows for sophisticated knowledge organization without inline content duplication.
**Files**: CLAUDE.md

### [15:22] [architecture] Chronicler file linking strategy
**Details**: Migrated from duplicating content in CLAUDE.md to using file links. CLAUDE.md now only contains critical instructions and a link to .claude/knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md. This leverages Claude Code's 5-hop file linking capability to reduce duplication and maintain a single source of truth. File sizes: CLAUDE.md reduced from 189 to 49 lines, while knowledge files contain 633 lines of detailed documentation.
**Files**: CLAUDE.md, chronicler-quicken, incantations/chronicler/append-to-CLAUDE.md, incantations/chronicler/scripts/chronicler-quicken

### [15:25] [architecture] Claude memory file references vs markdown links
**Details**: Claude Code uses @ references (not markdown links) to load files. Format: @path/to/file.md loads the file content. We maintain two knowledge maps: KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md for users (with markdown links) and KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md for Claude (with @ references). CLAUDE.md keeps chronicler-tagged sections with the knowledge gathering protocol and @ reference to KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md.
**Files**: CLAUDE.md, .claude/knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md, .claude/knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md

### [17:02] [pattern] Git union merge for session files
**Details**: Implemented git merge=union strategy for .claude/knowledge/session.md files to prevent merge conflicts when multiple team members gather knowledge simultaneously. Uses .gitattributes file with "session.md merge=union" rule. This tells git to automatically combine both versions during merges instead of creating conflicts. The pattern is distributed via append-to-gitattributes file in the incantation and installed by install.sh script. This ensures all gathered knowledge is preserved and combined during merges without manual conflict resolution.
**Files**: .claude/knowledge/.gitattributes, incantations/chronicler/append-to-gitattributes, incantations/chronicler/install.sh

### [17:05] [config] Session.md no longer gitignored
**Details**: Removed session.md from .gitignore since we now use git merge=union strategy to handle conflicts. This allows session.md to be committed and shared across team members. The union merge strategy automatically combines all gathered knowledge during merges without conflicts. Deleted the append-to-gitignore file from chronicler incantation as it's no longer needed.
**Files**: .gitignore, incantations/chronicler/append-to-gitignore (deleted)
