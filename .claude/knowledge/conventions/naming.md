# Naming Conventions

## Incantations Directory Structure

The project uses `incantations/` instead of the typical `packages/` for its modular directory structure, aligning with the grimoire theme. Each incantation is a self-contained magical system that can be 'summoned' (installed) via commands.

**Key Points:**
- Directory: `incantations/` (not `packages/`)
- Purpose: Contains self-contained magical systems
- Installation: Via `summon [incantation-name]` command
- Theme: Makes the project more fun and memorable while maintaining clear organizational structure

**Example:**
```bash
summon chronicler  # Installs the chronicler documentation system
```

This thematic naming reinforces the project's identity as a "book of spells to assist in summoning arcane, para-conscious horrors."
