# Installation Workflows

## Summoning Incantations

Future installation workflow will use the `summon [incantation-name]` command to install and configure magical systems.

### How It Works

1. **Command**: `summon [incantation-name]`
2. **Process**:
   - Runs the incantation's install script
   - Appends configuration fragments to appropriate files
   - Enables any required MCP servers
   - Sets up necessary dependencies

### Example: Summoning Chronicler

```bash
summon chronicler
```

This would:
- Install the chronicler documentation system
- Append chronicler sections to CLAUDE.md
- Add MCP server configuration to settings.local.json
- Set up the .knowledge directory structure

### Theme Alignment

This workflow aligns with the grimoire's theme of summoning arcane entities to do your bidding, making the development experience more engaging and memorable.
