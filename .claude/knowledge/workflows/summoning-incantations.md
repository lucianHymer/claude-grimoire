# Summoning Incantations Workflow

Install magical systems using the `summon [incantation-name]` command.

## Process
1. Run `summon [incantation-name]` (e.g., `summon chronicler`)
2. Install script executes:
   - Appends configuration fragments to target files
   - Installs git hooks if present
   - Enables MCP servers via settings
3. Incantation becomes active in the project

## Theme
- Aligns with grimoire's concept of summoning arcane entities
- Makes development experience more engaging
- Maintains clear functionality beneath thematic wrapper

## Example
```bash
summon chronicler  # Installs the chronicler documentation system
```

This thematic workflow provides both practical functionality and an engaging development experience.
