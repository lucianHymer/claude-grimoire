# Session File Tracking Configuration

## Current Status
Session.md is **no longer gitignored** as of the union merge implementation.

## Previous Configuration (Deprecated)
Previously, `.knowledge/session.md` was excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to avoid conflicts.

## Current Configuration
- Session.md is tracked in git
- Uses git merge=union strategy via `.gitattributes`
- Automatically combines gathered knowledge during merges
- No conflicts when multiple contributors gather knowledge

## Migration
- Removed session.md from `.gitignore`
- Deleted `incantations/chronicler/append-to-gitignore` file
- Added `.gitattributes` with union merge rule

This change enables collaborative knowledge gathering without merge conflicts.
